# CSS Class Reference

The CSS is organized using [Harry Robertsâ€™](https://csswizardry.com) [Inverted Triangle CSS][itcss] (ITCSS) organizational approach. This method is mixed with [Block Element Modifier][bem] (BEM) naming convention for class names throughout the Sass files.

## Partials

We will use partials (a.k.a. components) a `partials` directory for all partials on the site. When creating a new partial keep these in mind:

1. Partials should be broken down into the smallest manageable and reusable size.
1. Partials should be styled with custom BEM classes or a collection of utility classes.
1. Layout styles should not be done in the partial, but instead on the referencing page or partial.

## CSS Classes

When creating new CSS classes, be sure to reference the [Sparkbox standard][sb-standard-sass] for best practices.
